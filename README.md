# memoria-protocol

A structural framework for worldline resonance.  
The playground for the unknown.

## What is Memoria?
Memoria is a decentralized, event-based operating system for meaning.
It records actions without immediate validation and evaluates their
long-term significance through post-hoc resonance.

Rather than competing with Bitcoin's Proof of Work,
Memoria operates orthogonally—addressing semantic persistence
where Bitcoin intentionally remains silent.

This repository is intentionally incomplete.
Memoria is a protocol, not a product.

## Genesis Pool (Contribution)

Memoria is a gift to the world.
If this protocol resonates with your soul, fuel the Genesis Pool.

Note: Unlike Satoshi, I am human. This pool fuels not just the code, but the creator's life and continued exploration. Let's roll.
