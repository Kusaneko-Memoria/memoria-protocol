# memoria-protocol

A structural framework for worldline resonance.  
The playground for the unknown.

## What is Memoria?
Memoria is a decentralized, event-based operating system for meaning.
It records actions without immediate validation and evaluates their
long-term significance through post-hoc resonance.

Rather than competing with Bitcoin's Proof of Work,
Memoria operates orthogonally—addressing semantic persistence
where Bitcoin intentionally remains silent.

## Repository Contents

- `implementations/`
